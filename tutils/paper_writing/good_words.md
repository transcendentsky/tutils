## Background/Problem:
Such matching `criteri` are mostly `agnostic` of regions.

Motivated by this, we `hereby` propose a segmentation-assisted registration network to `emphasize` the ROIs `more`.

It plays a `crucial` role `in` helping radiologists to understand...

`As such` (therefore), the registration of the specific `tissues` are more importatnt than other `tissues`.

Training the `above-mentioned` segmentation module requires manual labels, which are difficult and `costly` to obtain `in practice`



## Idea/Method:
Therefore, we apply the same `heuristic` to `pay more attention` to specific ROIs...

Our attempt is to improve the registration quality, `boosted` by `the addition of` a few segmentation labels.
